% non-linear model state space feedback velocity control using C-language compatible formulation
% performs integration by Euler's method
% VCPendDotCB is the callback function to compute xDot 
% a1, a2, b0Â are coedfficients  
% C, D are the state space model output matrices
% K id the state feedback control ggain - unused here
% t is a vector of time samples
% x0 is the initial state vector
